This dataset contains two types of information. You will find first a graph obtained by focusing on the neighborhood of 10 nodes in facebook. This should be your main focus.

In addition, we provide the original data that is more complex. It consists of 'circles' (or 'friends lists') from Facebook. Facebook data was collected from survey participants using this Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles), circles, and ego networks. Facebook data has been anonymized by replacing the Facebook-internal ids for each user with a new value. Also, while feature vectors from this dataset have been provided, the interpretation of those features has been obscured. For instance, where the original dataset may have contained a feature "political=Democratic Party", the new data would simply contain "political=anonymized feature 1". Thus, using the anonymized data it is possible to determine whether two users have the same political affiliations, but not what their individual political affiliations represent. Facebook data was collected from survey participants using this Facebook app. The dataset includes node features (profiles).
